# Milestone 2: DevOps Project - README

## Introduction

The **Delivery Date Column** feature aimed to provide additional information about the delivery process within the company's internal application. It introduced a new database column, `delivery_date`, to store and display delivery dates associated with orders.

## Feature Details

### How It Works

The feature operates by capturing and displaying the delivery date information for each order. The `delivery_date` column is integrated into the backend database schema and reflects the expected delivery date for an order.

### Utilization

- **For Developers:** The `delivery_date` column was designed to be easily integrated into the existing codebase. Developers can refer to the [Code Implementation](#code-implementation) section for details on how to incorporate and utilize this feature.

- **For End-Users:** End-users can benefit from the added visibility into the delivery process. The `delivery_date` is displayed in relevant sections of the user interface, providing crucial information about order timelines.

## Reversion

Despite its initial introduction, the **Delivery Date Column** feature has been reverted. The decision to revert was made based on reasons provided earlier. Developers and end-users should be aware that the feature is no longer part of the application.

## For Developers

### Code Implementation

Developers who may need to understand or modify the original implementation can follow these steps:

#### Branch Information:

- The feature was implemented in a branch named `feature/delivery-date`.
- The feature has been reverted in a branch named `revert-delivery-date-3`.

#### Reverting the Feature:

Developers can refer to the [Reversion](#reversion) section for steps on how to revert the changes.

## For End-Users

### User Interface Changes

End-users may have observed changes in the user interface related to the `delivery_date` column. However, these changes have been reverted, and the feature is no longer active.

### Benefits

While the feature was active, end-users could benefit from improved order tracking, with added information about expected delivery dates.

## Future Considerations

Although the **Delivery Date Column** feature has been reverted, there may be future considerations for its reintroduction or replacement. Any future development related to order tracking should carefully evaluate the necessity and implementation of such features.
