- **Data Validation:** Ensure data accuracy and completeness with required fields, date restrictions, and card number validation.

- **Delivery Date Column:** An additional field is available to capture the Delivery Date of an order. While the feature is currently inactive, it can be activated by merging the changes from the "feature/add-delivery-date" branch into the main branch.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

For the application to succesfully run, you need to install the following packages:

- flask (version 2.2.2)
- pyodbc (version 4.0.39)
- SQLAlchemy (version 2.0.21)
- werkzeug (version 2.2.3)

### Usage

To run the application, you simply need to run the `app.py` script in this repository. Once the application starts you should be able to access it locally at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. Here you will be meet with the following two pages:

1. **Order List Page:** Navigate to the "Order List" page to view all existing orders. Use the pagination controls to navigate between pages.

2. **Add New Order Page:** Click on the "Add New Order" tab to access the order form. Complete all required fields and ensure that your entries meet the specified criteria.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Flask is used to build the backend of the application, handling routing, data processing, and interactions with the database.

- **Frontend:** The user interface is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience.

- **Database:** The application employs an Azure SQL Database as its database system to store order-related data.

### Docker containerization

**1. Dockerfile Creation:**
We utilized an official Python runtime as our parent image, specifically public.ecr.aws/docker/library/python:3.9.10-slim-buster. The working directory in the container was set to /app, and the application files were copied into the container's /app directory.
**2. System Dependencies and ODBC Driver Installation:**
System dependencies and the ODBC driver were installed to support the application. The installation process involved updating the package manager, installing necessary dependencies, and configuring the Microsoft ODBC driver.
**3. Pip and Python Package Installation:**
We upgraded pip and setuptools before installing Python packages specified in the requirements.txt file.
**4. Port Exposure and Startup Command:**
The Dockerfile exposed port 5000, which is the port the Flask application runs on. The startup command was set to launch the Flask application.


**Usage Instructions:**
Ensure Docker is installed on your system.
Build the image using the provided Dockerfile.
Run the container, exposing port 5000.
Access the application on http://localhost:5000.
